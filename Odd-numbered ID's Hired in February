Find employees who started in February and have odd-numbered employee IDs.

worker_id	first_name	last_name	salary	joining_date	department
1	Monika	Arora	100000	2014-02-20	HR
2	Niharika	Verma	80000	2014-06-11	Admin
3	Vishal	Singhal	300000	2014-02-20	HR
4	Amitah	Singh	500000	2014-02-20	Admin



SOLUTION:

worker['joining_date'] = worker['joining_date'].astype(str)

worker_feb = worker[worker['joining_date'].str.startswith('2014-02')]

worker_odd = worker_feb[worker_feb['worker_id']%2 !=0]
