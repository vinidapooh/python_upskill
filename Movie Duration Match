As a data scientist at Amazon Prime Video, you are tasked with enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for Amazonâ€™s airline partners. Your challenge is to develop a feature that suggests individual movies from Amazon's content database that fit within a given flight's duration. For flight 101, find movies whose runtime is less than or equal to the flight's duration.


The output should list suggested movies for the flight, including 'flight_id', 'movie_id', and 'movie_duration'."

DataFrames: entertainment_catalog, flight_schedule




SOLUTION:

import pandas as pd

flight_movies_cross = pd.merge(
    flight_schedule.assign(key=1), 
    entertainment_catalog.assign(key=1), 
    on='key'
).drop('key', axis=1)

suitable_movies = flight_movies_cross[
    flight_movies_cross['duration'] <= flight_movies_cross['flight_duration']
]

result = suitable_movies[['flight_id','movie_id','duration']].sort_values('duration')

final_result = result[result['flight_id'] == 101]
