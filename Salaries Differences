SOLUTION:
import pandas as pd

df = pd.merge(db_employee, db_dept, how = 'left', left_on = 'department_id',right_on = 'id')

df_dept = df[(df['department'] == 'marketing') | (df['department'] == 'engineering')]

df_max = df_dept.groupby('department')['salary'].max().reset_index()

df_max['salary'].diff().iloc[-1]
